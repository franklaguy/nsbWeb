	<h2>Articles</h2>
	<p>There is some debate over sections -vs- articles. Astehetically they appear to do the same thing. They are both containers. Here's where articles and the use of articles differ. Proper use of an article means you can take the content with the article itself and move it completely into another space or format (print for example). You should be able to take a whole article and have it make sense anywhere else you put it. With a section, there is a looser format whereas you could have a series of articles, or other elements. Articles need to be self contained.</p>
	<h2>Canvas Element</h2>
	<p>The canvas element is rich in promise and inventiveness. I'd say it's great for designers and ultra creative types. There are some really cool sites out there that utilize this feature with incredible results. Unfortunately, I for one am not one of those type's. Personally I've found the canvas element to belong to a niche group. I'd like to stay inline with what we can utilize today thinking in a cross browser type of way.</p>
	<p>Just to give a glimpse for those of you who may want to look further into the canvas element, it's very possible to create a photoshop type drawing pad including cropping using the canvas tag in html5, css3 and javascript. Try it out and see for youself. Let me know how that works out for you. The canvas element is not very efficient with cross browser compatibility.</p>
