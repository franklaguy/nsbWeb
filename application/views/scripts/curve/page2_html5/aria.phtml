	<h2>Accessible Rich Internet Application specification (ARIA)</h2>
	<p>ARIA introduces the role="" element, which is useful for section 508 compliance. It gives meaning to a tag (div or section) in much the same way a class or id would, meaning it can be called and styled. In some browsers (IE) it can be styled whereas an HTML5 tag currently would not be called via css. Role attributes describe an elements purpose for other developers to be able to read the same code clearly. It's predominant use is to give accessibility to the disabled. Crawlers will pick up a role attribute easily so if there is a section of the page that you feel needs to be identified specifically, be it for clear code footprints or 508 compliance, roles are a long time recognized way of accomplishing your goal.</p>
	<p>Using the role tag is considered extending semantics. It's used in addition to well formed HTML5. Another extension is microformatting. Microformatting gives way to the creation of vcards and hcards (think contact info). By microformatting or specifically naming via class an address (class=address) and wrapping it in an HTML5 address container, you've created the perfect index for a crawler to pick up. Good going, buddy.</p>
	<p>Role is something that does not validate in firefox html5 validator, however, like most html5 tags it probably soon will. It's one of those forgiveable warnings. The benefits are much greater than the downside considering the only real downside is the validation.ARIA is backwards compatible back to ie7 whereas html5 does not go back that far in some instances. Therefore using the role attribute presently gives access to more browsers than just those that support html5.</p>
